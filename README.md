# Buddy
Buddy lets you pair up with another player before the round begins, and spawn in on the same team as them. This can let friends play together more easily.

## Installation
To install Buddy, just download the latest release at https://github.com/PintTheDragon/Buddy/releases , then stick Buddy.dll in your sm_plugins directory. After you launch your server, you can configure it.

## Configuration
For the most part, Buddy works out of the box, but you may want to configure it. To change the commands and things it says, go to sm_translations and open buddyplugin.txt. From there, you can modify the commands/responses. Actual config doesn't work yet.

## Usage
To use buddy plugin, run ".buddy <friend's name>" before the round starts (friend's name does not need to be exact). Then, your friend needs to run ".baccept". That's it! You will both spawn in on the same team.
